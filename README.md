# switchtheme ( name pending :^) )
A simple and in no way complete perl script to change terminal theme on the fly


## Usage
Put your .Xresources theme files in .config/themes, switchtheme will create a symlink to the one you choose via the CLI interface in ~/.Xtheme and add (if it's not already there) the necessary #include to your .Xresources.

This is mainly for personnal use and is likely to break, I do however plan to develop it further into a multipurpose theme browser and switcher.
